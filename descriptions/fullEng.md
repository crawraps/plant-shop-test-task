# Task

This project is a test task for obtaining a junior frontend developer vacancy. The essence of the task was to create one page of the site using pure [js](), [html]() and [css]().

# Creation

When receiving the task, the use of [typescript]() and [sass]() was not stipulated, so I decided to make my life easier and use these tools. I also divided the code and styles into different files for easier code writing.

Since this is a test task, I do not know what else to talk about here, so that's all.
